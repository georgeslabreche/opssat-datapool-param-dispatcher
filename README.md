### Steps
1. Install the `dev` branch of NanoSatMO Framework (NMF) following [the NMF quick start guide](https://nanosat-mo-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html)

2. Get and build the Datapool Stress Tester application
```
$ git clone https://github.com/georgeslabreche/opssat-datapool-stresstester
$ mvn install
```

3. Deploy the application in the NMF SDK following [the NMF deployment guide](https://nanosat-mo-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apps/packaging.html). Replacing instances of "sobel" by "datapool-stresstester" and "Sobel" by "StressTesterApp" in the main class name.

## Starting
Follow [the lastÂ 3 steps of the NMF SDK guide](https://nanosat-mo-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sdk.html#running-the-cubesat-simulator). 

Alternatively, use the `build.bat` script after editing the `PROJECT_DIR` and `NMF_SDK_PACKAGE_DIR` to match your development environment's file system. Running `build.bat` builds the project. Running `build.bat 1` builds and runs the project.
